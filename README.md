# Gesture Recognition with Hand Tracking

This project utilizes hand tracking with Mediapipe and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize hand gestures and predict corresponding letters of the American Sign Language alphabet. The CNN model has been trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset.

### Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure to install the required libraries:

`pip install tensorflow opencv-python mediapipe keras pandas numpy`

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
